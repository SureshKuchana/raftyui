# Import

Rafty UI exports 4 components to help you create a Card.

- Card: The parent wrapper that provides context for its children.
- CardHeader: The wrapper that contains a card's header.
- CardBody: The wrapper that houses the card's main content.
- CardFooter: The footer that houses the card actions.

```jsx
import { Card, CardBody, CardFooter, CardHeader } from "@rafty/ui";
```
