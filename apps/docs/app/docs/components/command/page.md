The Command component in React can function as a menu and also serves as an accessible combobox.

When you render items with it, it automatically filters and sorts them. It offers a fully composable API, allowing you to wrap items in other components or even use static JSX. This component is made on top of [CMDKs Command Component](https://cmdk.paco.me/) with our styling conventions. This component has been shared with you, ensuring that all its native properties are accessible.

## Anatomy

Import the component.

```jsx
import { Command } from "@rafty/ui";

<Command />;
```
