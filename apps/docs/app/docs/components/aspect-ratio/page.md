The Aspect Ratio component resizes its contents to match the desired ratio.

This component is made on top of [Radix UIs Aspect Ratio Component](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/aspect-ratio) with our styling conventions. This component has been shared with you, ensuring that all its native properties are accessible. If you need to apply your own styling you can use the `isBarebone` (to remove styling from entire component and its subcomponents) or `isUnstyled` (to remove styling from a particular subcomponent). These props have been forwarded to you, granting access to all its native properties.

## Anatomy

Import the component.

```jsx
import { AspectRatio } from "@rafty/ui";

<AspectRatio />;
```
