## Installing Rafty UI

Rafty UI is made up of multiple components and tools that you can import one by one. All you need to do is install the @rafty/ui package:

```sh
yarn add @rafty/ui

# or

npm i @rafty/ui
```

## Setup

For the styling to work in `@rafty/ui`, you need to make few changes in your `tailwind.config.js` file.

First, install the `@rafty/plugin` package as devDependencies

```sh
npm i -D @rafty/plugin
```

And in your `tailwind.config.js` file

```js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    ...,
    "./node_modules/@rafty/ui/**/*.{js,cjs}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
        ...,
        // (Optional)
        // Extend the default configuration of @rafty/ui
        colors: {
            primary: colors.purple,
            ...,
        }
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    ...,
    require("@rafty/plugin")
  ],
};
```

## Get Started

```jsx
import { Button } from "@rafty/ui";
```
