## Quick start

Rafty UI is made up of multiple components and tools that you can import one by one.

### Installing Rafty UI

To use Rafty UI in your project, run one of the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
npm add @rafty/ui
# or
yarn add @rafty/ui

# or
yarn add -D @rafty/plugin
# or
pnpm add -D @rafty/plugin
```

And in your `tailwind.config.js` file

```js
module.exports = {
  darkMode: "class",
  content: [
    // ...,
    "./node_modules/@rafty/**/*.js",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      // (Optional)
      // Extend the default configuration
      colors: {
        primary: colors.purple,
        // ...,
