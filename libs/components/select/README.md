# @rafty/select

The Select component is a component that allows users pick a value from
predefined options.

Ideally, it should be used when there are more than 5 options, otherwise you
might consider using a radio group instead.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @rafty/select

# or

npm i @rafty/select
```

## Import Components

```jsx
import { Select, SelectItem, ListBox } from "@rafty/select";
```
