# @rafty/toast

The toast is used to show alerts on top of an overlay.

The toast will close itself when the close button is clicked, or after a timeout
â€” the default is 5 seconds.

Toasts can be configured to appear at either the top or the bottom of an
application window, and it is possible to have more than one toast onscreen at a
time.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @rafty/toast

# or

npm i @rafty/toast
```

## Import components

```jsx
import { Toast } from "@rafty/toast";
```
