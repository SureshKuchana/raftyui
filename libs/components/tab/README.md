# @rafty/tab

The `Tab` and `TabPanel` elements are associated by their order in the tree. None of the components are empty wrappers, each is associated with a real DOM element in the document, giving you maximum control over styling and composition.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @rafty/tab

# or

npm i @rafty/tab
```

## Import components

```jsx
import { Tab, TabContent, TabList, TabTrigger } from "@rafty/tab";
```
