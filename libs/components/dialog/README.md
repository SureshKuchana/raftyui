A dailog is a window overlaid on either the primary window or another dialog
window. Contents behind a dailog are **inert** meaning that users cannot
interact with content behind the dialog.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @rafty/dailog

# or

npm i @rafty/dailog
```

## Import Components

```jsx
import { Dialog, DialogBody, DialogClose, DialogCloseButton, DialogContent, DialogOverlay, DialogHeading, DialogTrigger } from "@rafty/dailog";
```
